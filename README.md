# Rick and Morty React Router

Basic website to experiment with react router functionality.

- AboutPage.jsx should render general about me information about the show. (Maybe use an API to render this information?)
- CharactersPage.jsx should render a Card BootStrap Component (displaying image and information of said character) for every character within the Rick and Morty API Maybe use useState, useEffect, axios, async, map, conditional rendering?
- Routes for each page mentioned above within Reacts Browser Router
- NotFound.jsx should render an error message letting the user know this page does not exist
- Error Route to render NotFound.jsx
- NavBar.jsx should allow users to navigate your project
- Testing with Cypress to ensure all requirements are being met
- Styling from React BootStrap or Tailwind.css

- CharacterDetailsPage.jsx should display all the information pertaining to a single character. Ensure to utilize useParams.
- A dynamic route that will display CharacterDetailsPage.jsx
- Implement a functionality for useNavigate through your program

- FavoriteCharactersPage.jsx should display all characters marked as favorite by the user
- Route to render FavoriteCharactersPage.jsx as a child of App.jsx
- Users should be able to add or remove Characters from their Favorites and they can't have more than 4 favorite characters at a time
- Ensure to utilize ReactBootStrap and Tailwind.css for styling
- Add a Cypress test suite that will reinforce all the requirements above.
